            <h1 class="text-center">Pelvic Floor?</h1>
            <p>Do you leak when you run, jump or sneeze? Do you need to go at the worst times? Do you let your pelvic
                floor keep you from achieving your fitness or weight loss goals, or do you manage to hide your
                difficulty while wishing you wouldn't have to?
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Pelvic floor dysfunction imcompasses a range of symptoms including mild incontinence to more serious
                conditions such as severe pelvic pain and even pelvic organ prolapse. <b>Many women believe pelvic floor
                    dysfuntion is simply a reality of life that can not be avoided or improved.</b> Because of this,
                they neglet to strengthen these muscles. Unfortunately, weak pelvic floor muscles usually progress to
                more serious conditions as women age. In reality,<b> pelvic floor dysfunction is not something you have
                    to live with!</b> The pelvic floor is part of the body's core; the center of strength, movement and
                balance. Therefore, <b>training the body properly starts with training the core.</b> You don't need to
                live with dysfuntion any longer! Together we can win!
            </p>
            <br>
            <h1 class="text-center">Ready For Lasting Change?</h1>
            <p>If you train with Together Won, you are training from the core out.  While wokouts will include
            exercises to strengthen the core, they will always be customized to meet your fitness needs and
            goals.  <b>Expect to build strength, endurance, and confidence</b> as we zero in on your body's unique chemistry
            and how it can become as healthy and efficient as possible.  If weight loss is your goal, expect
            workouts that <b>effectively increase caloric burn both during and after the exercise session</b>, 
            along with guidance on healthy living to ensure lasting change. Don't settle. Together we can win!

                        <h1>Kristen Nielsen</h1>
                        <h2>ACE Certified Personal Trainer <br> Pelvic Floor Specialist</h2>
                        <p>Kristen is a Colorado native who grew up climbing 14,000ft. mountains. She
                            also developed a passion for running and swimming, both of which she competed Division I in
                            college. After college Kristen had the privelege of becoming a mother to 4 amazing children.
                            It was after her pregnancies that Kristen experienced first hand how pelvic floor dysfunction 
                            can affect anyone; college athelete or not. Desiring to restore her pelvic floor so that
                            she could remain active, Kristen sought out advice but found it difficult to
                            receive practical help. After becoming an ACE certified personal trainer, Kristen
                            specialized in core and pelvic floor function in hopes to bring others the answers to
                            pelvic floor damage prevention and restoration. She desires for others to ultimately
                            experience the same freedom she has re-gained.  Kristen's training approach is foundational and
                            functional. She knows how to begin where the client most needs help, and build upon this to 
                            ultimately train clients to their fullest potential. So, whether they are
                            struggling to walk a mile, or training for a collegiate sport, Kristen helps her clients reach 
                            the next level. These days you may spot Kristen sprinting down the street or leaping
                            in the air as she plays with her children. She is excited to help others find freedom as well!
