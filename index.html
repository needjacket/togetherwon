            <h1 class="text-center">Core-Power</h1>
            <p>Core training is <b>not</b> simply about flattening your stomach, or trying to get a "6-pack".
            The core contains deep muscles that are
            central to strength, balance and control for the entire body.  As women transition through different stages
            of life, correct core function is key to maintaining an active lifestyle.  <b>Symptoms such as accidental urine
            leakage, toilet urgency, pelvic pain, trouble balancing, and lower back pain are all signs of a compromised
            core</b>.  Many women ignore these problems or assume they are just a normal progressions in life.  Good news!
            Proper core training restores critical muscles, reclaiming freedom for women and ensuring their long-term function.
            </p>
            <p>
            If you experience <b>back pain</b>,
            <b>accidental leakage</b>, have been <b>pregnant</b>, or simply struggle to perform everyday movements,
            core training is critical to restoration.  If you are an <b>athlete</b> seeking to increase power and speed,
            or a pregnant woman hoping to maintain strength before and after pregnancy, you need core training to achieve
            your goals.
            <br>

                            with Kristen, I have strength to do things that I never imagined that I could do again.
                            I love working with Kristen. She is creative and encouraging. The workouts that she wrote
                            specifically for me are varied, use equipment that I have, and are fun to do. I can continue
                            to gain strength and stamina on my own. I am confident using what I have learned to work
                            out daily in a variety of ways.</p>

                            She patiently asked pertinent probing questions to help identify my personal goals
                            for strength and conditioning.  Her physical assessment uncovered issues that I had
                            just learned to accept without realizing how they were impacting my life.
                            Her detailed plan kept in mind my busy schedule as well as my goals.
                            Can’t wait to see where this goes!.</p>

                                routine just for me. I can already see a difference in my game. Working with Kristen was

                        <h2>ACE Certified Personal Trainer <br> Core Training Specialist</h2>
                        <p>Kristen is a Colorado native who grew up climbing 14,000ft. mountains. She
                            also developed a passion for running and swimming, both of which she competed Division I in
                            college. After college Kristen had the privelege of becoming a mother to 4 amazing children.
                            It was after her pregnancies that Kristen experienced firsthand how core dysfunction
                            can affect anyone; college athelete or not. Desiring to restore her core so that
                            she could remain active, Kristen sought out advice but found it difficult to
                            receive specific and practical help. After becoming an ACE certified personal trainer Kristen
                            specialized in core training in hope to bring others the answers to
                            core strengthening and restoration. She desires for others to ultimately
                            experience the same freedom she has re-gained.  Kristen's training approach is foundational and
                            functional. She knows how to begin where the client most needs help, and build upon this to
                            ultimately train clients to their fullest potential. So, whether they are
                            struggling to walk a mile, or training for a collegiate sport, Kristen helps her clients reach
                            the next level. These days you may spot Kristen sprinting down the street or leaping
                            in the air as she plays with her children. She is excited to help others find freedom as well!
