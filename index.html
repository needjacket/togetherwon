            <h1 class="text-center">Core?</h1>
            <p>Core training is <b>not</b> simply about flattening your stomach, or trying to get a "6-pack". 
            The core contains deep muscles that are
            central to strength, balance and control for the entire body.  As women transition through different stages
            of life, correct core function is key to maintaining an active lifestyle.  <b>Symptoms such as accidental urine
            leakage, toilet urgency, pelvic pain, trouble balancing, and lower back pain are all signs of a compromised
            core</b>.  Many women ignore these problems or assume they are just a normal progressions in life.  Good news!
            Proper core training restores critical muscles, reclaiming freedom for women and ensuring their long-term function. 
            </p>
            <p>
            If you experience <b>back pain</b>,
            <b>accidental leakage</b>, have been <b>pregnant</b>, or simply struggle to perform everyday movements,
            core training is critical to restoration.  If you are an <b>athlete</b> seeking to increase power and speed, 
            or a pregnant woman hoping to maintain strength before and after pregnancy, you need core training to achieve
            your goals.

            <br>
            <h1 class="text-center">Ready For Lasting Change?</h1>
            <p>When you train with TogetherWON, you are training from the core out.  Your workouts will be
            customized to meet your fitness needs and goals.  Expect to build strength, endurance, and confidence 
            as we zero in on your body's unique chemistry

            workouts that effectively increase caloric burn through
            heartrate driven zone-training. <b>Pregant or post-partum?</b> Workouts will be safe and effective for 
            you and baby.
            <b>Over 55?</b> Workouts will account for the changes that occur in females with age.

                            <p class="text-left">Working with Kristen has been an awesome experience. 
                            She patiently asked pertinent probing questions to help identify my personal goals
                            for strength and conditioning.  Her physical assessment uncovered issues that I had 
                            just learned to accept without realizing how they were impacting my life.  
                            Her detailed plan kept in mind my busy schedule as well as my goals.  
                            Can’t wait to see where this goes!.</p>

                        <h1>Kristen Nielsen</h1>
                        <h2>ACE Certified Personal Trainer <br> Core Training Specialist</h2>
                        <p>Kristen is a Colorado native who grew up climbing 14,000ft. mountains. She
                            also developed a passion for running and swimming, both of which she competed Division I in
                            college. After college Kristen had the privelege of becoming a mother to 4 amazing children.
                            It was after her pregnancies that Kristen experienced firsthand how core dysfunction 
                            can affect anyone; college athelete or not. Desiring to restore her core so that
                            she could remain active, Kristen sought out advice but found it difficult to
                            receive specific and practical help. After becoming an ACE certified personal trainer Kristen
                            specialized in core training in hope to bring others the answers to
                            core strengthening and restoration. She desires for others to ultimately
                            experience the same freedom she has re-gained.  Kristen's training approach is foundational and
                            functional. She knows how to begin where the client most needs help, and build upon this to 
                            ultimately train clients to their fullest potential. So, whether they are
                            struggling to walk a mile, or training for a collegiate sport, Kristen helps her clients reach 
                            the next level. These days you may spot Kristen sprinting down the street or leaping
                            in the air as she plays with her children. She is excited to help others find freedom as well!
